    "text": "The data includes records of all 3,237 documented oil spills that occurred in California in the year 2008, both off the coast in the ocean in addition to inland. Los Angeles County experienced 512 oil spills in 2008, the most spills of all the California counties, followed by San Diego with 418 oil spills and San Mateo County with 205 oil spills. Modoc County was the only to experience zero oil spills in 2008. The mean number of oil spills by county was about 53, and the median 16.5. This discrepancy in center measurements can be explained by Los Angeles and San Diego Counties experiencing significantly more oil spills than the rest of the counties, whereas 41 of the 58 counties fall below the mean.\n\n\nCalifornia Fish and Wildlife.

Note the different scales of y-axis between each of the characters. Donkey is a chatty character that is present throughout the entire movie, whereas Fiona is less talkative and does not appear until the end of the film. Therefore, Donkey says many more words throughout the film and his word counts are higher for each of the measured sentiments. The colors correspond to the characters’ appearances: Shrek is a green ogre, Fiona is a slightly softer green in her ogre form, donkey is gray, and Lord Farquaad wears a maroon outfit."

In this analysis, a beta function was defined by the formula given in Table 1, Equation 2.5 of the cited paper.

    "text": "The dataset analyzed below contains information about two species of palmetto: saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) and scrub palmetto (Sabal etonia). Two binary logistic regression models were developed to predict the palmetto species based on a set of morphological features and compared. Model 1 predicts the species of an individual based on its plant height, canopy length, canopy width, and number of green leaves; whereas Model 2 predicts the species only based on plant height, canopy width and number of green leaves.\nPseudocode:\n\nLoad libraries and data, identify factor levels in metadata\nVisualize relationship between species and its predicting variable in exploratory ggplots\nCreate binary logistic regression models using both formulas\n20-fold cross validation on model 1, repeat 10 times\n20-fold cross validation on model 2, repeat 10 times\nCompare models using AIC, accuracy, ROC curve and AUC\nCreate table of best fitting model coefficients using kable\nCreate table of best fitting predictive performance for the entire dataset\n\nModel 1 slightly outperforms Model 2, correctly predicting 90.75% of Serenoa repens and 92.61% of Sabal etonia. This suggests that the plant’s canopy length (included in Model 1, but omitted in Model 2) is an essential predictive variable for differentiating between the two palmetto species."
