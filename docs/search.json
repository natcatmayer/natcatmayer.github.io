    "text": "The data includes records of all 3,237 documented oil spills that occurred in California in the year 2008, both off the coast in the ocean in addition to inland. Los Angeles County experienced 512 oil spills in 2008, the most spills of all the California counties, followed by San Diego with 418 oil spills and San Mateo County with 205 oil spills. Modoc County was the only to experience zero oil spills in 2008. The mean number of oil spills by county was about 53, and the median 16.5. This discrepancy in center measurements can be explained by Los Angeles and San Diego Counties experiencing significantly more oil spills than the rest of the counties, whereas 41 of the 58 counties fall below the mean.\n\n\nCalifornia Fish and Wildlife.
