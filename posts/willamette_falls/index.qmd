## Overview

This report includes population data on Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead fish collected daily at the Willamette Falls fish ladder between 2001-2010. The plots below illustrate both the seasonality of fish species migrating through Willamette Falls and the general trend in population size over the ten year period. Also included is a forecasting model used to predict Coho Salmon population from 2010-2025.

## Part 1: Original Time Series

-   The time series below shows a steady increase in Coho individuals between 2001-2010, with population size surpassing 1000 individuals around 2010.
-   Jack coho populations remained relatively constant, apart from a notable peak at about 400 individuals in 2009.
-   Steelhead populations have a seasonal but persistent presence at the Willamette Falls fish ladder, whereas both Coho and Jack coho are only observed there during specific small windows of the year.

```{r}
# plot time series for each species 

coho <- ggplot(fish_ts, aes(x = date)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = coho)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = " ", 
       y = "Coho")

jack <- ggplot(fish_ts, aes(x = date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = jack_coho)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
    labs(x = " ", 
       y = "Jack Coho")

steel <- ggplot(fish_ts, aes(x = date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=steelhead)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
    labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Steelhead")

graph showing population is measured for Coho salmon by intervals of 500, the middle graph showing population

Steelhead increases by intervals of 100.",

fish_graph
```

## Part 2: Seasonplots

-   Coho and Jack coho are observed at the Willamette Falls fish ladder exclusively in and around October each year, whereas Steelhead are observed there year-round with peaks between mid spring to mid summer.
-   The number of Coho individuals observed in the fall each year has increased between 2001-2010.
-   Jack coho population appears to steadily rise to a peak in 2009 followed by population decline.

Jack Coho in intervals of 50, and Steelhead 100. The colors represent each year between 2001-2010 with red representing

## Part 3: Annual counts by species

-   Note the different y-axis scales in each of the figures below. Coho populations reach a maximum of over 250,000 individuals; Steelhead about 50,000; and Jack coho only about 3,000 individuals.
-   Coho salmon population levels were relatively low between 2001-2008 followed by a significant jump in 2009 followed by a slight decline in 2010.
-   Jack coho populations experienced extreme fluctuations between 2001-2008. Whereas, steelhead populations appear relatively consistent if not slightly declining between 2001-2010.

```{r}
fish_totals <- fish_ts %>%
  separate(date, c('year', 'month', 'day')) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(Coho = sum(coho), 
            Jack_Coho = sum(jack_coho), 
            Steelhead = sum(steelhead)) %>%
  pivot_longer("Coho":"Steelhead", 
               names_to = "species", 
               values_to = "total")

fish_total_plot <- ggplot(data = fish_totals, 
       aes(x = year, 
           y = total, 
           fill = species)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol=1, scales = "free") + 
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Total Fish at Fish Ladder", 
       fill = "Fish Species", 
       caption = "The figures above show the annual totals for fish passage at the Willamette fish lader from 2001-2010.
