Hi and welcome to my website! I'm Natalie, a Master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management specializing in Water Resources Management. Profesionally, I am interested in analyzing water supply and quality data using Excel, RStudio, or ArcGIS! Outside of work, I enjoy hiking and going to the beach with my Australian Shepherd, Polly. Please explore this website to checkout some of my work!
